1. Please complete the [Software Setup](https://agmath.github.io/ClassificationCourse/SoftwareSetup.html) for our course before our next class meeting. If you have any trouble, please drop by my office and I'll help you.

**Note:** Having a completed setup prior to our next class meeting will be worth a *Homework Assignment* grade.
