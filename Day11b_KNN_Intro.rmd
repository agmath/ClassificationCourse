**Purpose:** In this notebook we introduce the *$k$ nearest neighbors* classifier. In particular, we note that

+ the $k$ in the name of the classifier indicates the number of *voting* neighbors when a prediction is made.
+ *nearest neighbors* is a distance-based model.

  + Numerical predictors should be scaled in order to use this class of model.
  + Categorical predictors are not supported by *nearest neighbor* models without significant assumptions made regarding relationships between their levels.
  + *Nearest neighbor* models suffer greatly from *the curse of dimensionality*.

## The Big Idea

A *nearest neighbor* model assumes that observations are most like those nearest to them. The nearest neighbor model makes predictions on a new observation in the following way:

1. Identify the $k$ observations which are *closest* to the new observation. (**Note:** It is possible to use a variety of distance metrics, not just the Euclidean metric.)

2. Allow those $k$ "nearest neighbors" to vote on the response for the new observation.

The following visual may be helpful.

```{r echo = FALSE}
num_obs <- 50
num_nbrs <- 5
new_obs <- tibble(X1 = 6,
                  X2 = 5)

x1 <- runif(num_obs, 0, 10)
x2 <- runif(num_obs, 0, 10)
class <- rep(0, num_obs)

for(i in 1:num_obs){
  class[i] <- sample(c("orange", "purple"), size = 1, prob = c((x1[i] + x2[i])/20, 1 - (x1[i] + x2[i])/20))
}

toy_data <- tibble(X1 = x1,
                   X2 = x2,
                   Class = class)

closest_obs <- toy_data %>%
  mutate(distance = sqrt((X1 - new_obs$X1)^2 + (X2 - new_obs$X2)^2)) %>%
  slice_min(distance, n = num_nbrs)

voted_class <- closest_obs %>%
  count(Class) %>%
  slice_max(n, n = 1) %>%
  pull(Class)

ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = toy_data,
             aes(x = X1,
                 y = X2,
                 color = Class),
             size = 2) +
  geom_point(aes(x = new_obs$X1,
                 y = new_obs$X2),
             color = "black",
             size = 5) +
  geom_segment(data = closest_obs,
               aes(x = new_obs$X1, y = new_obs$X2,
                   xend = X1, yend = X2),
               lty = "dashed") +
  coord_equal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("orange", "purple")) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(x = "X1",
       x = "X2",
       title = paste0("Nearest Neighbors with k=", num_nbrs),
       subtitle = paste0("The voted class is ", voted_class))
```

## About KNN
  
Given the two stage process, you might note that a *nearest neighbor* model isn't actually *trained*. The "locations" and responses for the training data are simply stored, and when a prediction is to be made, the algorithm is run. This has several implications.

+ The *nearest neighbor* approach is not a *model*, it is really an algorithm to obtain predictions.
+ The *nearest neighbor* approach is expensive in terms of memory requirements because the entire "training" set must be stored in perpetuity.
+ The *nearest neighbor* approach is expensive in terms of compute time because the algorithm must be run in full every time a new prediction is to be made.
+ The *nearest neighbors* algorithm is non-parametric and no functional form is estimated.

  + This means that *nearest neighbors* does not result in an interpretable model like linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, or others do.

Where *nearest neighbor* approaches have the drawbacks cited above, they do have some significant advantages. In particular, they can approximate very complex decision boundaries. We can also *tune* the parameter $k$ in order to obtain an appropriately flexible boundary.

## Regression and Classification

It is worth noting that $k$ *nearest neighbors* can be used in both the *classification* and *regression* settings.

+ For *classification*, each neighbor provides a vote for the class of the new observation and the plurality wins. 
+ For *regression*, the value of the response for each of the nearest neighbors are averaged to obtain the predicted response for the new observation.

## How to Implement in `{tidymodels}`

A KNN classifier is a model class (that is, a model `spec`*ification*). We define our intention to build a KNN classifier using

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
knn_clf_spec <- nearest_neighbor() %>%
  set_engine("kknn") %>%
  set_mode("classification")
```

K Nearest Neighbors can be used for *both* regression and classification. For this reason, the line to `set_mode()` is required when declaring the model specification. The line to `set_engine()` above is unnecessary since `kknn` is the default engine. There are other available engines though.

#### Hyperparameters and Other Extras

Like other model classes, nearest neighbors have *tunable hyperparameters*. They are

+ `neighbors`, which determines the number of *voting neighbors* to determine the model's ultimate prediction on a new observation.

  + Remember, the fewer voting neighbors, the more flexible the model is.

+ `weight_func` determines how we'll compute distances between observations. More than just Euclidean distance (`"rectangular"`) are available. 

You can see the full `{parsnip}` documentation for `nearest_neighbor()` [here](https://parsnip.tidymodels.org/reference/nearest_neighbor.html){target="_blank"}.

## Summary

In this notebook we learned a bit about the $k$ *nearest neighbors* algorithm. In particular, we saw that this is a distance-based algorithm which can be used for either regression or classification. We also saw that it is a non-parametric method which does not result in a *model* and cannot be interpreted. The algorithm is run every time a new prediction is to be made, making *nearest neighbors* an expensive algorithm in terms of both space and time. While *nearest neighbors* has its drawbacks it is a powerful technique which can fit very complex decision boundaries in the classification setting and can approximate complex functions well in the regression setting. *Nearest neighbors* also makes no distribution assumptions about the underlying data -- only that observations are most similar to those around them.

We'll implement $k$ *nearest neighbors* using the `nearest_neighbor()` model class from `{tidymodels}` in our next class meeting.
