**Purpose:** This notebook covers several common deep learning architectures. In particular, we will see architectures for:

+ Linear Regression as a Neural Network
+ Logistic Regression as a Neural Network
+ Deep Learning Neural Networks
+ Recurrent Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory Networks
+ Convolutional Neural Networks
+ Autoencoders

We'll also discuss use-cases for each of these types of network.
